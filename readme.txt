Simples todo list, show crud work in high level JS Script

use of localStorage and simple use of html

the ideia is create a todolist to be the predecessor of the app android todo list

just run the html and index in same folder and everything should work as intended, the task.js in other hand is like the previus version, is more complex, I want to put them togheter in the same html to see the diferences
